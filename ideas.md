## 아이디어 1: Neo-Brutalism Digital Street Culture

**Design Movement**: Neo-Brutalism meets Korean street fashion aesthetics

**Core Principles**:
- Raw, unapologetic visual language with harsh shadows and stark contrasts
- Asymmetric layouts that feel spontaneous and rebellious
- Bold geometric shapes that break traditional grid systems
- Intentional "imperfection" that feels authentic and anti-corporate

**Color Philosophy**: 
Deep charcoal black (#0A0A0A) as the foundation, with electric neon accents—vibrant cyan (#00F0FF) for primary actions and hot magenta (#FF006E) for secondary highlights. The palette evokes Seoul's neon-lit alleyways at night, creating urgency and energy. Colors are used sparingly but with maximum impact.

**Layout Paradigm**: 
Diagonal-cut sections with aggressive angles (15-20 degrees), creating a sense of movement and disruption. Content blocks overlap intentionally, with some elements "breaking" their containers. Mobile-first with thumb-zone optimization—CTAs positioned in natural reach areas.

**Signature Elements**:
- Thick, brutalist borders (8-12px) around key elements
- Glitch effects on hover states
- Oversized, cropped typography that extends beyond viewport edges
- Rough grain texture overlay (subtle noise) for tactile depth

**Interaction Philosophy**:
Interactions feel immediate and visceral. Buttons don't just change color—they shift position slightly, creating a "punch" effect. Scroll-triggered animations are abrupt and attention-grabbing, not smooth and gentle. The interface demands engagement rather than inviting it politely.

**Animation**:
- Harsh, snappy transitions (0.15s cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1))
- Staggered entrance animations with 50ms delays between elements
- Parallax effects on diagonal sections for depth
- Micro-interactions: button press creates brief chromatic aberration effect

**Typography System**:
- Display: Space Grotesk (800 weight) for headlines—geometric, bold, slightly quirky
- Body: IBM Plex Sans (400/500) for readability with technical precision
- Hierarchy: Extreme scale contrast (72px headlines vs 16px body on mobile)
- Korean text: Pretendard Variable (700/500) for optimal Hangul rendering

## 아이디어 2: Liquid Minimalism with Kinetic Energy

**Design Movement**: Scandinavian minimalism infused with fluid, organic motion

**Core Principles**:
- Extreme whitespace as a luxury element
- Fluid, morphing shapes that suggest constant evolution
- Monochromatic base with single accent color for focus
- Content hierarchy through scale and motion, not decoration

**Color Philosophy**:
Midnight navy (#0D1117) as primary background, with pure white (#FFFFFF) text for maximum legibility. Single accent: electric violet (#8B5CF6) used exclusively for interactive elements and data visualization. The restrained palette creates sophistication and lets content breathe, while the violet provides just enough energy to feel modern and tech-forward.

**Layout Paradigm**:
Vertical rhythm based on 8px grid system, but with intentional "breathing" sections—large empty spaces that force the eye to focus on what remains. Asymmetric single-column layout on mobile, expanding to offset two-column on desktop. Content floats in space rather than filling it.

**Signature Elements**:
- Animated gradient blobs that morph slowly in the background (CSS blur + transform)
- Floating cards with subtle depth (2px shadow, 1px border)
- Circular progress indicators that animate on scroll
- Soft-edged dividers using SVG wave patterns

**Interaction Philosophy**:
Interactions are smooth and anticipatory. Elements respond to cursor proximity (magnetic effect), creating a sense of intelligence. Micro-animations provide feedback without overwhelming—a button doesn't just change color, it subtly expands and contracts like a breath.

**Animation**:
- Fluid, eased transitions (0.4s cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1))
- Morphing gradient backgrounds that shift hue on scroll
- Staggered fade-ins with 80ms delays for elegance
- Hover states: gentle scale (1.02x) with shadow depth increase

**Typography System**:
- Display: Syne (700 weight) for headlines—modern, slightly condensed, elegant
- Body: Inter (400/500) for clean readability
- Hierarchy: Moderate scale (48px headlines vs 18px body on mobile)
- Korean text: Pretendard (600/400) for harmonious bilingual pairing
- Letter-spacing: -0.02em on headlines for tighter, more intentional feel

## 아이디어 3: Cyberpunk Data Visualization Aesthetic

**Design Movement**: Cyberpunk meets data-driven design with HUD-inspired interfaces

**Core Principles**:
- Information density as a feature, not a bug
- Layered transparency creating depth through overlapping panels
- Technical precision with grid systems and alignment guides visible
- Data as decoration—numbers, metrics, and real-time elements integrated into design

**Color Philosophy**:
Pure black (#000000) background with neon cyan (#00FFFF) as primary accent and deep purple (#7C3AED) as secondary. Tertiary colors: lime green (#84CC16) for success states, amber (#F59E0B) for warnings. The palette references 1980s sci-fi interfaces and Korean PC bang culture, creating nostalgia and futurism simultaneously. Colors glow with subtle outer shadows to simulate screen bloom.

**Layout Paradigm**:
Grid-based but with intentional breaks—content aligned to 12-column grid, but key elements (CTAs, stats) float in dedicated "zones" that overlap grid boundaries. Corner-anchored UI elements (like a game HUD) provide navigation and context. Diagonal scan lines and corner brackets frame sections.

**Signature Elements**:
- Glowing neon borders with subtle animation (pulsing opacity 0.6-1.0)
- Hexagonal containers for data points
- Animated scan lines that sweep across sections
- Corner brackets and technical callouts (like "SECTOR 02" labels)

**Interaction Philosophy**:
Interactions feel like operating a high-tech interface. Buttons have multi-stage feedback: hover reveals border glow, click triggers brief flash and sound (optional). Data counters animate when scrolled into view, counting up from zero. The interface feels responsive and alive, like a system actively processing information.

**Animation**:
- Sharp, mechanical transitions (0.2s ease-in-out)
- Number counter animations using GSAP-style easing
- Glitch effects on state changes (brief RGB split)
- Parallax scrolling with multiple depth layers
- Hover: glow intensity increase + subtle translate-y(-2px)

**Typography System**:
- Display: Orbitron (900 weight) for headlines—geometric, futuristic, tech-forward
- Body: Roboto Mono (400/500) for technical precision and readability
- Hierarchy: Strong contrast (64px headlines vs 14px body on mobile)
- Korean text: Noto Sans KR (700/400) for clean Hangul rendering
- Monospace for all numbers and data points to create technical aesthetic
- Text-shadow: 0 0 10px currentColor for neon glow effect on headlines
